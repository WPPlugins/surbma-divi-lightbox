Adds Divi's native lightbox effect to images.

== Description ==

This plugin adds the Divi Lightbox effect to all images in the content area, that is linked to a media file. It means clicking on the image will open it in a lightbox. This is a very lightweight plugin, almost no impact on pageload.

The original idea came from Tevya, who also financed this project.
